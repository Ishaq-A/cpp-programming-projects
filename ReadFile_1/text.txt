For Windows Operating System:

"C:\\directory\\subdirectory\\folder\\filename"

You must use two backslashes as a single slash is a character literal
thus, you must use two backslashes.

For Linux/Mac/UNIX Operating Systems:

"/directory/subdirectory/folder/filename"

This also works with windows as the correct separator
replaces the forward slash behind the scenes.
